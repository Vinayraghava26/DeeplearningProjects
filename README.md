# DeeplearningProjects
This repository serves as a showcase of my deep learning projects, focusing on utilizing neural networks, including RNNs and CNNs, to tackle various challenges. The projects included are:
1. Churn classification.
2. Spam message classification.
3. Image Logo classification.

Each project not only demonstrates the application of deep learning methodologies but also showcases my expertise in the field. The data utilized in these projects were collected from Kaggle competitions, offering real-world scenarios to apply and validate the effectiveness of the developed models.
